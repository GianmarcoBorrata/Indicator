Dear Konstanze Lauseker,

Thank you for your detailed feedback regarding my package submission. I have addressed the issues as outlined:
Package names, software names, and API names are now consistently written in single quotes in the title and description.
Descriptions do not begin with "This package", the package name, or similar phrases.
References describing the methods in the package have been added in the specified format.
Information messages are no longer written directly to the console. Instead, objects are generated to allow users to extract the information they need. 

I have made these modifications and am now resubmitting the package for your review.

Thank you for your guidance and assistance.

Best regards,
Gianmarco Borrata

Dear

I have made the last requested corrections. Now the titles of references in the description are written in 'quotation marks' instead of 'single quotation marks', as per the example: 'Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators: Methodology and User Guide'.

Also, we have released an update to the package to correct an error in 'polarity' in the following functions:

- linear_aggregation_MPI
- linear_aggregation_AMPI
- min_max_GM
- Standardization_AMPI

Sincerely,
Gianmarco Borrata
